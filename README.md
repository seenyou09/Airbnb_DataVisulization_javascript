# Sanfrancisco_Airbnb_Visualization

There are hundreds of Airbnb sites in San Francisco to choose from and the Airbnb filter can only do so much to help you. Rather than scrolling through all these sites, we wanted to create a visualization allowing customers to choose their ideal site quickly. We wanted the customer to know all the necessary information at one glance at our visualization. Therefore, we have a dot map that expresses the spatial relationship. On the other hand, the bar graph will compare the chosen Airbnb site’s price and ratings based on the average of its neighboring sites.


One of the most important factors in choosing one’s site is the price and the overall rating. To present a more informative visualization, we gave a more in-depth analysis of the bar chart by dividing it based on cleanliness, accuracy, value, and other factors. We will dive deeper into these ratings later on my data portfolio page.
